/// Bite DJ: the history is USB-centric.
///
/// Its top level is the drives, not the sessions: every mounted USB volume gets
/// a node, and under it are the sessions that were played off *that* drive,
/// read from (and written to) the drive's own `.bitedj/history.sqlite` (see
/// FsHistoryStore). Pull the stick, plug it into another Bite DJ unit, and the
/// sets it played come with it. A fixed "This Unit" node keeps the sessions of
/// tracks that were not on a removable drive, which are still ordinary setlog
/// playlists in this box's library database.
///
/// Sidebar item payloads are therefore no longer all playlist ids. The nodes
/// backed by a drive carry a string (see the k*Prefix constants in the .cpp),
/// which BasePlaylistFeature's helpers read as "not a playlist" — QVariant::
/// toInt() fails on them — so its playlist actions decline them instead of
/// acting on some unrelated playlist. Everything under "This Unit" is an
/// ordinary playlist id and behaves exactly as it did before.
