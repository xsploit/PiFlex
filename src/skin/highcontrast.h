/// Bite DJ: high-contrast ("daylight") mode.
///
/// The skin is a dark theme, which is what a booth wants and what a screen in
/// direct sun is worst at: an LCD's blacks wash out to grey outdoors, so a
/// light-on-dark UI loses most of its contrast exactly when it is needed. This
/// flips the whole skin to dark-on-light without maintaining a second theme —
/// every colour is derived from the one the skin already declares.
///
/// Colours invert in HSL space: lightness flips, hue and saturation ride
/// through untouched. A plain RGB inversion would turn the danger red cyan and
/// the playing-deck orange blue, and this skin's state colours are required to
/// mirror the hardware LEDs.
///
/// Three parse-time hooks cover the skin between them:
///   - `mapStyleSheet()` from `LegacySkinParser::getStyleFromNode()` — every
///     QSS sheet the skin declares, plus the SVG icons its `url()`s name.
///   - `ImgHighContrast` installed by `ColorSchemeParser` — every colour read
///     from skin XML (`WSkinColor::getCorrectColor`: waveform signal/beat/mark
///     colours, `WOverview`, knobs, labels) and every image loaded through
///     `WPixmapStore`/`WImageStore` (knob.svg, the effect meters).
///   - `mapColor()` for the handful of colours hard-coded in C++.
/// Because those all run while the skin is being built, a toggle reboots the
/// skin view rather than trying to repaint in place — see `enabledChanged`.
