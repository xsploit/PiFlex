/// Bite DJ: the daylight-mode filter in the skin's image/colour pipeline.
///
/// `ColorSchemeParser` installs this on `WPixmapStore`, `WImageStore` and
/// `WSkinColor` while the mode is on, which puts one hook in front of both
/// halves of the skin that a stylesheet cannot reach:
///   - every colour read out of skin XML, because they all land in
///     `WSkinColor::getCorrectColor()` — the waveform's background, signal,
///     beat and mark colours, `WOverview`, `WLabel`, knob and slider colours;
///   - every image the skin loads, i.e. knob.svg and the effect meters, which
///     are named from XML rather than from QSS and so are invisible to the
///     stylesheet transform.
///
/// Distinct from the stock `ImgInvert` colour-scheme filter, which inverts RGB
/// outright. This flips HSL lightness only, so a dark waveform on a light page
/// keeps its signal hues and the state colours keep mirroring the LEDs.
