// and wake, so letting it cut in costs a few microseconds.

/// This is for long CPU-bound jobs that must yield to whatever is feeding the

/// that hand the audio callback its next chunk, and which are SCHED_OTHER at
/// nice 0, because QThread::HighPriority maps to nothing under SCHED_OTHER
/// (see the caution in main()). At equal weight, analyzers saturating those
/// cores delay the reads past the buffer deadline and the decks glitch.
///
/// Deliberately *not* demoteCurrentThreadToIdle(): an analyzer holds the
/// global track cache and database locks that the reader threads also take,
/// and SCHED_IDLE only runs when nothing else on the machine wants the CPU,

/// thread — a priority inversion on the exact path this was meant to protect.

/// forward progress and always releases the lock. EngineSideChain can afford
/// SCHED_IDLE because it shares no lock with the audio path.
